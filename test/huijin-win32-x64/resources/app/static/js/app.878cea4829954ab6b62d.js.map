Currently, the ledger has only one flag defined for `closeFlags`: **sLCF_NoConsensusTime** (value 1). If this flag is enabled, it means that validators were in conflict regarding the correct close time for the ledger, but built otherwise the same ledger, so they declared consensus while \\\"agreeing to disagree\\\" on the close time. In this case, the consensus ledger contains a `closeTime` value that is 1 second after that of the previous ledger. (In this case, there is no official close time, but the actual real-world close time is probably 3-6 seconds later than the specified `closeTime`.)\"},\"ledgerHash\":{\"$ref\":\"hash256\",\"description\":\"Unique identifying hash of the entire ledger.\"},\"ledgerVersion\":{\"$ref\":\"ledgerVersion\",\"description\":\"The ledger version of this ledger.\"},\"parentLedgerHash\":{\"$ref\":\"hash256\",\"description\":\"Unique identifying hash of the ledger that came immediately before this one.\"},\"parentCloseTime\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"format\":\"date-time\",\"description\":\"The time at which the previous ledger was closed.\"},\"totalDrops\":{\"$ref\":\"value\",\"description\":\"Total number of drops (1/1,000,000th of an XRP) in the network, as a quoted integer.
